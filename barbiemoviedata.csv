&gt;Greta Gerwig’s #Barbie    is an ABSOLUTE marvel of a film. She is able to infuse this simple story with so much emotion, excitement, and comedy. Her style shines bright. Margot Robbie and gosling shine brighter then the sun, this is such a great movie. The hype is REAL.

[From @JStepback](https://twitter.com/JStepback/status/1678255313567318017?s=19) 
&gt; Barbie    is a cinematic triumph. Gerwig is at the top of her game here, she’s crafted a film that’s not only gorgeous to look at, but poignant, clever and hilarious. Margot Robbie delivers an endearing and memorable performance, though it’s Gosling who stole every scene he was in

***


[From @EzeBaum](https://twitter.com/EzeBaum/status/1678252850797764608?s=19)
&gt; Barbie    is a triumph. A pitch-perfect script backed by great performances — particularly from Ryan Gosling — turns what could be a simple studio comedy into a sharp commentary on our society that makes its nuance palatable for those that may not take it at face value. GG is 3/3.

[From @theatomreview](https://twitter.com/theatomreview/status/1678255117764534272?s=19) 
&gt;Barbie    REVIEW: Heartfelt &amp; hilarious! Margot Robbie’s crown jewel performance (Oscars here we come). It’s super fun, endearing &amp; magical with a 3rd act that’ll beach you off. This isn’t just another comedy, it’s Greta Gerwig’s BEST movie ever!! A fitting end setting what’s next


***

[From @DennisDuganFan](https://twitter.com/DennisDuganFan/status/1678253445944430593?s=19) 
&gt; Barbie    was a deeply cathartic experience. It’s about industrialization of art/iconography forming sensibility instead of individualism, and Greta tells it with so much joy and heart. I was cackling at Gosling’s himbo Ken one scene and bawling my eyes out at the next. A classic

[From joedeckelmeier](https://twitter.com/joedeckelmeier/status/1678252716479647745?s=19)  
&gt; Barbie    caught me off guard &amp; I mean that in the best way possible. It’s funny, bombastic, &amp; very smart.  Greta Gerwig aims for the fences &amp; hits a home-run. Margot Robbie’s performance is great &amp; @RyanGosling &amp; @SimuLiu are pure entertainment! The whole cast is brilliant!


***

[From JamieCinematics](https://twitter.com/JamieCinematics/status/1678252810834710530?s=19 ) 
&gt;I can't officially quit Twitter before telling you all that #Barbie    is currently my favorite film of the year. Greta Gerwig somehow exceeded my expectations. She tackles the positives and negatives of Barbie so beautifully. Give Ryan Gosling an Oscar nomination, I'm dead serious!

***

[From BamSaum](https://twitter.com/BamSaum/status/1678254844669308928?s=19) 
&gt;Anyway I can finally say that I saw #Barbie    and it’s wonderful and hilarious and moving and Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig!



***

[From EHeckler](https://twitter.com/EHeckler/status/1678257702517063680?s=19) 
&gt;Barbie    is Ryan Gosling’s best role to date—Greta Gerwig takes everything that has made him great in his previous films and combines them into a Super-Gosling. The Oscar buzz is real, and if it happens it would be one of the most fun and inspired nominations in recent memory.

***

[From Kyle Buchanan](https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/1678271659705511937?s=19) 
&gt;Further BARBIE thoughts to come but the number one is I can’t believe Greta Gerwig got away with it! (said admiringly)
&gt;BARBIE is two hours of that! I was grinning and gobsmacked throughout… like how did she evade what must have been five binders full of executive notes


***

[From MKUltraMoney](https://twitter.com/MKUltraMoney/status/1678285216375242753?s=19)
&gt;Now that the #Barbie    embargo is finally up I can tell you guys it was fucking KINO. I saw it back in like February. Ryan Gosling as Ken is literally me and is his career best performance. Kind of ironic Ken steals the show in Barbie’s movie.
